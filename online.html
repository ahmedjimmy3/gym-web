                     <p>online programmes are designed to give everyone access to elite level Strength and Conditioning programming wherever they are in the world. We created these programmes because we had a huge lack of Strength and Conditioning guidance growing up and wasted years with trial and error in our own training. We don’t want that to happen to anyone else.</p>
                     <p>By joining our online team you will gain access to our periodised high performance rugby programmes aimed at building better athletes. We focus on developing your muscle mass, maximal strength and explosive power. In addition to the rugby programmes we also have our body composition programmes which focus on either gaining muscle mass or losing body fat. There’s less focus on sporting carry over in these programmes.</p>
                     <p>If you want to compete at the top, then you need to train like a pro. Most people don’t have access to this type of programming because all the top S and C coaches are in house working with professional clubs or international teams. Between the 3 coaches in the academy we have a combined experience of over 50 years and in addition to that one of them is a 2 times British and Irish Lions captain and the other a professional S and C coach who has been coaching elite teams for the past 20+ years. </p>
                     <p>Inside SW7 Academy you’ll get access to the exact same Strength & Conditioning programming only available in today’s top rugby academies and professional teams. As well as the gym based training programmes we also have pitch conditioning, off feet conditioning, recovery sessions, which consist of mobility and yoga sessions coached by the top in the business.

As well as the gym based training programmes we also have pitch conditioning, off feet conditioning, recovery sessions, which consist of mobility and yoga sessions coached by the top in the business. We also have many brand partners where you can access amazing discounts such as supplement companies, meal prep and gym kit to name a few. </p>
                     <p>You will receive your programme through our app and once you have completed a sign up questionnaire we will deliver your programme in 4 week blocks. Each session will have full video exercise demonstrations, sets and reps to follow and you can input your weights used which will save in your training history so you can ensure that you’re progressing throughout the programme. We also have a fully individualised nutrition programme. Again from the on boarding questionnaire we will extract all the information we need in order to set the right amount of calories and macros for your goals. You can also select any food preferences you have, foods you dislike so we can ensure we don’t include them in your meals and you can even choose how many meals and snacks you want to have in a day as we understand everyone has different preferences and eating habits.</p>
                     <p>We have been fortunate enough to build an amazing community inside the academy. We have an active Facebook group where members can ask any questions that either the coaches or the more experienced members will answer. We also have biweekly live Q and A sessions with head coach Chris Tombs so you can delve a bit deeper.</p>
                     <p>Our goal is to build you into a better athlete by focusing on developing your muscle mass, maximal strength and explosive power. Whatever your goals we have the programmes and support systems to ensure you reach them!</p>

The music is blaring and the atmosphere is awesome. You will not do the same workout twice and if you go you will see the results no question. It’s a life changing gym experience and I recommend it highly to all my fiends and family.</p>

From the ownership, to management, to the trainers, by far the nicest and most knowledgeable staff in the business today. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend (GN) to anyone. I am certainly satisfied thus far and have been blown away by my experience at this new facility</p>
