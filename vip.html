                     <p>This is our elite level 1-1 online training service. Members will have personal contact with head coach Chris Tombs, whether it be via whatsapp, email or calls, Chris will be there to help the athlete every step of the way. This is designed for people who either want that extra level of support and accountability to ensure they hit their goals. We have had a lot of players who are wanting to improve their game come on board or clients wanting to make their local first team right through to prospective international players.</p>
                     <p>“Chris was one of the most influential coaches I’ve ever had. His professionalism, support, mentorship as well as his obvious first class training methods make him stand out from the rest.” Sam Warburton.</p>
                     <p>Sam and Chris were a team for 8 years while Sam was playing professionally at Cardiff Rugby. This time saw Sam move from a graduate academy player into the first team at the Cardiff Blues, achieve a 40m speed PB, every strength PB he has had, his first cap and so much more within his professional career. </p>
                     <p>Elite level programming is only available to professional sportsmen and with our VIP performance pathway, this is made available to you. We are giving you this rare opportunity because you want to commit to your athletic performance and we want to ensure you get there.</p>
                     <p>It’s true that within professional sport and amongst the most elite athletes, Chris is the coach you want. With experience in the industry spanning the last</p>
                     <p>20+ years, having Chris as your coach, personally checking in with you and keeping you on track is the accountability you need to be an athlete.</p>
                     <p>His robust philosophy for physical preparation has evolved and been refined over the years to help all athletes reach their potential and break barriers they didn't think were possible.</p>
                     <p>You can apply to work with Chris on our VIP programme below. Please note, due to the bespoke nature of these plans, there are limited spaces.</p>

                <p> I love this place. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get in shape. The trainers are really awesome and helpful, they make you feel really comfortable. The 45 min training goes super fast and you really enjoy doing it. Everyday is a new training, so it is never boring.</p>

                <p> The workouts are fun, the fellow members are inspiring, the workouts are led by personal trainers who give hands on instant feedback and adjustments during the workouts and just the right amount of encouragement. The music is blaring and the atmosphere is awesome. You will not do the same workout twice and if you go you will see the results no question. It’s a life changing gym experience and I recommend it highly to all my fiends and family.</p>

                <p> By far the best facility around. This new location is mint from the staff, to the equipment, to the facility itself. From the ownership, to management, to the trainers, by far the nicest and most knowledgeable staff in the business today. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend (GN) to anyone. I am certainly satisfied thus far and have been blown away by my experience at this new facility</p>

I really like how they give me tips and tricks to get the most out of every workout. I’ve been going for a little bit and am already seeing a big change in my energy levels and body. It’s great! I feel 10 years younger!</p>
