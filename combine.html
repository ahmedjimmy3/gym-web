                <h1>COMPREHENSIVE PROFESSIONAL TESTING</h1>
                <div class="papa">
                     <p>Our Combine days give teams or individual players the opportunity to come down and get professional tested by our head coach Chris Tombs.</p>
                     <p>Most gyms wouldn't have access to the technology that we have one hand and this makes our testing on par with a professional team set up. </p>
                     <p>We work with clubs around the UK and internationally to really help drive rugby development. We aim to provide programming for those who could lend on the extensive experience of Sam, Chris and Josh on how to get fitter, stronger, faster and more powerful.</p>
                     <p>In our experience, amateur teams rarely have a full strength and conditioning programme in place. We want players and teams to perform at their optimal level as I’m sure you do for your own team. Having your players at peak physical performance will have a huge impact on the pitch. They will be stronger, faster and more powerful than ever on our programmes. </p>
                     <p>You also have the option to book your entire team in for a combine testing day. Typically teams do this a few times a year so they can see who if any of their players are progressing. This is great to do around Pre-Season in particular. </p>
                     <p>a chance for players to come down and get professionally tested. We will then put together a performance card for you with your stats to show to your club or even teams that you are aspiring to play for. We want to help develop rugby and give players more opportunity to get seen and we think these combine days could play a huge role in that.</p>
                     <p>We have exclusive team memberships available and discounts vary depending on the number of teams or players that a team has. There is a minimum amount of players needed to start achieving the discounted pricing which is 15 players. They would have full access to the academy, the app and all the support available. </p>

                <p> By far the best facility around. This new location is mint from the staff, to the equipment, to the facility itself. From the ownership, to management, to the trainers, by far the nicest and most knowledgeable staff in the business today. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend (GN) to anyone. I am certainly satisfied thus far and have been blown away by my experience at this new facility</p>
