                     <p>The Lifting Club is our in person, face to face group coaching programme which is held at the University Of South Wales at their elite training facility. This is an amazing opportunity for anyone who wants to experience what it’s like training as part of a professional sports team.</p>
                     <p>The Lifting Club runs as a full 8 week training block and is for anyone who wants to improve physically. We focus on getting people stronger, faster and more powerful than ever before. You don’t have to play rugby to get involved, we have had regular gym goers, rugby players and football players attend, both female and male. Both younger and older athletes are more than welcome and we can tailor your programmes accordingly</p>
                     <p>Outside of rugby or contact sports in general, we also see this as an opportunity for those who want to become part of an amazing community and learn what it’s like to be part of a hard working, goal driven, professional training environment.</p>
                     <p>The LC is run by Chris Tombs, the head coach at SW7 Academy. Chris has 20+ years coaching elite sports working with Cardiff Rugby, Leicester Tigers, Seattle Seawolves MLR, USA Women's 7’s and USA Womens 15’s consultant. Chris oversaw the development and programming of the likes of British & Irish Lions Sam Warburton, Leigh Halfpenny and Jamie Roberts from the academy and into their professional careers also. Alongside Chris will be some additional coaches that he has hand picked to work with him. All members are provided with a full training programme to follow not only in the sessions but to do in their own time. They also get access to the SW7 Academy App so they can get all their nutrition in order as well. </p>
                     <p>We have full confidence that our programmes will help any and everyone who follows them to perform better on the pitch! All programs are hosted on our app where players can view and track their workouts. </p>
                     <p>We have gone all out to provide an elite level service here and as a part of that each member gets a recovery protein shake per session supplied by Pro Athlete Supplements (PAS) and a Canterbury Lifting Club T-shirt. </p>
                     <p>We have exclusive team memberships available and discounts vary depending on the number of teams or players that a team has. There is a minimum amount of players needed to start achieving the discounted pricing which is 15 players. They would have full access to the academy, the app and all the support available. </p>

                <p> I love this place. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get in shape. The trainers are really awesome and helpful, they make you feel really comfortable. The 45 min training goes super fast and you really enjoy doing it. Everyday is a new training, so it is never boring.</p>

                <p> The workouts are fun, the fellow members are inspiring, the workouts are led by personal trainers who give hands on instant feedback and adjustments during the workouts and just the right amount of encouragement. The music is blaring and the atmosphere is awesome. You will not do the same workout twice and if you go you will see the results no question. It’s a life changing gym experience and I recommend it highly to all my fiends and family.</p>

                <p> By far the best facility around. This new location is mint from the staff, to the equipment, to the facility itself. From the ownership, to management, to the trainers, by far the nicest and most knowledgeable staff in the business today. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend (GN) to anyone. I am certainly satisfied thus far and have been blown away by my experience at this new facility</p>
